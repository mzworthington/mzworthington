Over the summer I was lucky enough to speak at Karta conference in Frankfurt. I presented a lightning talk on CI/CD followed by a workshop called ‘Get to production!’. The goal of the talk and workshop was to cover the pipeline basics and for the group to have the opportunity to create and deploy a simple application using pipelines as code.
