Over the years I've run loads of workshops, brownbags, knowledge transfers, presentations and lightning talks. I'm immensely proud of what I achieved, however failed to really document or share these outside of the initial group. This felt wasteful.

I wanted a place to share my thoughts that wasn't confined to a private google drive or a set of notes that I rarely revisit. I have also set myself a goal to improve my writing skills and to share more of my experiences, and feel that this is a perfect place to do it.

Over the coming weeks or months (Depending on how much I procrastinate) I will be publishing articles on some of my achievements from the last couple of years. I want the timeline of this blog to match the timeline of my experience, therefore expect this welcome post to be somewhat oddly placed in the future.
