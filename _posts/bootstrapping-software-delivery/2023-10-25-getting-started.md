Often when setting up a new project/ programme/ product we forget to make our principles, constraints, and ways of working visible. There tends to be a group understanding however, churn happens and tribal knowledge dissipates. From no fault of any individual this can end in disaster and inevitably many difficult conversations.

Over the years Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working with many teams. Each team would have processes that help deliver value faster and better. I started to compile a list that I felt helped support a team, gave clarity on our constraints, and reduced uncertainty.

I wrote this guide initially for myself, I have a terrible memory and often I would forget about introducing certain processes, only to wish I had remembered and implemented them once something had gone wrong.

The goal of this guide is not to be a set of highly descriptive rigid rules. Every team is different, what works for one team may not work for another. I wanted to create a decent starter for 10, a set of living documents that should give enough to get going and drive guided and direct sessions that can fill in the gaps.
I will be adding to this series over the coming weeks, covering

* Get your teams up and running
* Delivery team's ways of working
* Architecture & Path to production
* Getting started with cross-functional requirements
* Running a live service

I hope you find them valuable
