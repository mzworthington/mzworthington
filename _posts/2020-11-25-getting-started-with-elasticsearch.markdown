I recently engaged with a client that wanted to improve their search relevance and speed. We decided to run some experiments to see if elastic search would be a good fit.

We wanted to be as visible as possible, and open for anyone interested to look at what we are doing. Many of the engineering team had not worked with Lucence based search engines before. I remember when I first used lucene, I felt pretty lost. So I threw together some lunch and learns, open to everyone that wanted to pop by and learn the basics of Elasticsearch.
